## Why?
Mostly because I need to organize my thoughts. I have bits and pieces of knowledge from here and there and I want to record them down for future reference.

I feel like if I don't write them down (in this case blog), I will forget most of them (which I eventually will). So I am determined to blog about the things that I learned and experienced throughout my daily life.

Also, it's because this gives me the opportunity to write more code while blogging. For those who already know me knows I love coding. It's a win win !

## What?
Yes what.

I plan to focus more on tutorials on how to get something working on the PC. For example, a tutorial on how to get AngularJS running or how exactly does crontab works in Linux.

This is mainly for my own benefit so that in the future I can refer to my blog and remember what I did if I do need to do it again. I found out that searching on [google](http://www.google.com) again and again is really not the way.

I tried bookmarking and it got too messy to organize. Hence, blog.

## When?
I was thinking _everyday_ but that's just too much. I don't have THAT much things to blog about every single day and if I am forced to blog once a day I will eventually give up. Either that or you see some weird posts.

Then I thought I should post only when I have something that's worth blogging about. This wouldn't work becauese then I would just be lazy and say nothing's worth blogging.

Finally I decided to blog at least once a week. Sounds reasonable? I shall give it a shot.
