This time, since it's Christmas, I would ommit the Hello World post and start off with a Christmas post!

Today, I spent my whole day learning [Jekyll][1] and how to make it work with [github pages][2].

Finally I stumbled upon [Jekyll Bootstrap][3] and used it after reading most of the [documentation][4] for Jekyll.

I then proceeded to install a few [themes][5] that Jekyll Bootstrap supports!

After configuring everything by following the instruction on the [Jekyll Bootstrap website][6] I am finally running the github pages with this post as my first post!

Now I'm good to go and done for today.

Here's a picture of Link
